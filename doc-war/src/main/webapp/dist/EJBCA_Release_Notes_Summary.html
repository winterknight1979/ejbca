<p   
>Nearly done by the release of 6.14 but not quite there, EJBCA 6.15's main feature is our support for the <a   href="ACME.html">ACME</a> protocol, up unto and including all mandatory features in <a  class="external-link" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-12">draft 12</a>. Naturally we've implemented it with full support for proxying communications over Peers through our RA, and support for multiple configurations using aliases as we do with other protocols.</p>
<p   
>Our implementation has been verified against <a  class="external-link" href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a>, <a  class="external-link" href="https://github.com/porunov/acme_client">PJAC</a> and <a  class="external-link" href="https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny">ACME Tiny</a>, and our <a   href="ACME.html">ACME documentation</a> describes how to configure them.</p>

<p   
>We've added two minor features to Custom Certificate Extensions. Firstly, we've added <strong class=" ">wildcards</strong> (identified by an <i class=" ">'*'</i>) to the OID field, which allows a defined extension to match against any array of extensions defined in an incoming request (e.g. in the above example, any request containing an extension ending in <i class=" ">.123</i>. The second addition is the <i class=" ">Required</i> property, which is by default checked.

<p   
>So far we've only implemented basic certificate management methods, and we'll be slowly moving on with implementing more powerful features in the near future. You'll find the complete offline API as a part of our documentation <a  class="external-link" href="https://www.ejbca.org/docs/rest">here</a>, or deployed locally with your EJBCA installation. For those of you wishing to integrate with EJBCA using REST we deploy <a  class="external-link" href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> on non-production installations in order to expose the API. Just like with all new protocols added to EJBCA, the REST API is disabled by default and needs to be manually activated.</p>

<p   
>Now is the winter of our new content, made glorious summer by our developers' hard work. EJBCA 6.11.1 is a brand new minor release containing some cool new features. We've upgraded the underlying BouncyCastle library version 1.59, which adds support for SHA3 signature algorithms.</p>
<p   
>The main feature of this release is a modification of how vendor certificates are handled in CMP. Previously we restricted CMP clients to enroll to the same subject DN and issuer as specified in the vendor certificate, while we now allow enrolling to a number of different certificates based on the same vendor certificate. The purpose of this change is to be able to use the same vendor certificate to enroll a device with several keys with different purposes.</p>
<p   
>We've fixed a few neat bugs, amongst which being a performance sink in the display of crypto tokens in the CA GUI, some minor issues related to EST and a case where a CA might incorrectly fail a CAA issuance check for some corner cases.</p>
<p   
>Being a minor release, this release involves no upgrade steps or notable database changes.</p>

<p   
>Patch release with some last minute fixes before the release of Appliance 2.7.2. Found issues include:</p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>A couple of minor regressions in relation to handling Approval Profiles in the CA and RA GUIs</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>Improved re-authentication checks in the CA and RA GUIs</p>

        <h2 class="heading "><span>EJBCA 6.11.0</span></h2>
<hr>
<p   
>First and foremost, EJBCA 6.11 introduces a long awaited feature: support for the EST protocol. For those of you now in the know, EST is an enrollment protocol similar to SCEP. Much like CMP and SCEP, EST can be configured through multiple aliases, and can like CMP also have calls proxied from an RA up a CA using the Peers Protocol.</p>
<p   
>The second main feature of this release is the concept of External Validators, a feature which has been widely requested by quite a few of our enterprise users. An External Validator functions much like the existing validators (RSA, CAA, etc), but it runs on either a certificate or pre-<br/>certificate object and calls on local script on the local system.</p>
<p   
>We've also added a few of features to make VA/RA installations more secure in the DMZ. In order to guard against possible 0-days or protocol vulnerabilities we've added the Protocol Configuration-tab to System Configuration. Through this tab all incoming protocols or servlets can<br/>be disabled. Additionally, we've added access rules to allow prohibiting CMP and WS calls being sent from the RA/VA to the CA via Peers in case the RA/VA runs the risk of being compromised. The second security feature is connected to the External Validator, adding a configuration value under System Configuration that disables both it and the General Purpose Custom Publisher. This configuration value is set to be disabled by default unless you're currently running a GeneralPurpose Custom Publisher in your installation.</p>
<p   
>Lastly, we've updated the VA so that SHA1WithRSA and SHA1WithECDSA are no longer acceptable signature algorithms for an OCSP responder, see the UPGRADE document for more information.</p>

<hr>
<p   
>This minor release introduces a couple of cool new features and above all a big performance improvement. We've added certificate extensions to CV certificates; these can be managed just like standard custom certificate extensions under System Configuration.</p>
<p   
>We've made a big change to how we handle CT logs. In 6.10.0 we added the option to make certain logs mandatory in anticipation to Google's enforcement of their updated CT specification in April 2018. Looking back we weren't entirely satisfied with our design, so have instead introduced the concept of CT Log Labels in order to group sets of logs. Instead of choosing a series of logs in the Certificate Profile you may choose a series of labels. Upon issuance all logs from those labels will be queried to, and the first n SCTs will be written to the certificate, where n is the max number of SCTs allowed and there will be at least one SCT per label. For those of you using the 'Mandatory'-option since 6.10, your logs will be automatically upgraded, which is documented further in the UPGRADE document.</p>
<p   
>Speaking of upgrading, you may have caught the EJBCA 6.3.2.6 Intermediate Release issued recently in order to facilitate upgrades from versions of EJBCA earlier than 5.0. In this release we've ironed out the last remaining upgrade bugs, as well as forbidding upgrades from versions of EJBCA prior to 5.0 in order to avoid errors in the future.</p>
<p   
>Lastly, we've put some time into optimizing certificate issuance in EJBCA. In comparison to 6.10, EJBCA 6.10.1 has about twice the throughput and half the latency in our benchmark environment for high volumes of certificate issuance.</p>

<p   
>Happy Halloween to all, we the Plucky Khobolds of PKI have been toiling away at another release.</p>
<p   
>Speaking of costumes and dressing up, EJBCA 6.10 introduces an extremely neat feature to the RA web: not only the ability to upload custom stylesheets and logos on the CA web to be used in the RA, and not only setting these per role, but having these transmitted to a remote RA over the Peers protocol. This means that the look-and-feel of an RA placed in an entirely different country than the CA can be modified CA-side without even requiring a restart of the RA, and it can be done for multiple users depending on their role.</p>
<p   
>On the theme of scares and frights, we're sure that nobody missed the ROCA vulnerability that was made public this month. While EJBCA has never used Infineon libraries for key generation (and to the best of our knowledge, none of our supported HSM vendors do either), we've still been capable of signing weak keys submitted from other sources. Fortunately since we introduced the RSA Key Validator back in EJBCA 6.9, adding a ROCA check there as well was trivial. For those of you running or planning on running RSA Key validation, we strongly recommend activating checking for ROCA weak keys.</p>
<p   
>On the CMP side we've added the concept of Central Key Generation which allows for a request for a keypair generated CA side to be transmitted and returned over CMP. Certificate Transparency has been given the ability to specify, apart from the minimum number of required logs, which logs which are considered mandatory to write to - this in anticipation of new requirements from Chrome coming in 2018. We've also kept working on our CAA validator, hammering out various corner cases and parallelizing DNS lookups for certificates containing multiple DNSNames.</p>
<p   
>From an upgrade perspective we're happy to see many legacy installations (EJBCA 4.0 and older) beginning to upgrade towards more modern versions of EJBCA, and have received some bug reports specific to older deployments which we've fixed in this release. Currently we support upgrading directly from EJBCA 5.0.16 or later. EJBCA 6.10 introduces no database changes, so upgrading from 6.9.x doesn't involve any automatic or manual upgrade steps.</p>

>For the first time in a while we're releasing a standard minor release, mainly concentrating on bug fixes and feedback from implements of our CAA Validator. All in all we've made the CAA Validator far more configurable, allowing features such as whitelisting some domains (excluding them from CAA checks), allowing the validator to ignore specific Top Level Domains and making recursion depth configurable. We've also added caching and robustness to DNS lookups in order to deal with the results query throttling from the resolvers. Add to that, we've also included a couple of minor performance improvements in connection to certificate issuance.</p>
<p   
>As the CAA standard is still involving we're not counting on our work in this field being finished quite yet, but for the moment we're hoping that you're all looking forward to all the neat new features coming in EJBCA 6.10 in a few weeks.</p>

>Delegated Keypair Generation: As requested by some customers running EJBCA instances as RAs over Peers, this feature is similar to the key recovery feature long used in EJBCA in that it stores generated soft keys encrypted in the database, but with the purpose that the soft keys are generated on the RA (instead of on the CA). The purpose of this is security - where the owner of the RA doesn't wish for the keys to ever be transmitted to the CA but merely be signed. Since this feature requires an EJBCA instance running as RA, it only applies to Enterprise customers.</p>
</li></ul><ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>RSA/ECC Key Validation: A long requested feature, we've now created an API for running validators during certificate creation. Foremost we've implemented Key Validators, which can be applied to a CA to reject incoming signing requests based on inadequate key length or poorly chosen exponents.</p>
</li></ul><ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>BlackList Validators: We've also developed an API for blacklisting signing requests based on known information. In EJBCA 6.9.0 we've implemented a Key Blacklist Validator, which will check incoming certificate requests against a user defined blacklist of known bad keys.</p>
</li></ul><ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>CAA: Last and absolutely not least, EJBCA 6.9.0 can perform CAA checks during or after certificate issuance. This has partly been implemented as a Validator (which is run during certificate issuance) or as a manual CLI tool which can be used by an RA administrator after issuance. CAA support is an Enterprise only feature.</p>
</li></ul>    </div>

<p   
>Just in time for the Swedish summer (all three days of it), we here at PrimeKey Solutions are very proud to release EJBCA 6.8.0, with a bunch of new features that we sincerely hope you'll enjoy. All in all, 190 issues that have been fixed for this release.</p>
<p   
>First and foremost, we've made some changes to Roles and Access Rules (see the UPGRADE document for technical details). Among these changes and improvements, we'd like to highlight the following:</p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>Managing rules in the Admin UI has been simplified, with a simpler Allow/Deny/Inherit-from-previous structure that we feel is way more intuitive and easy to overview. Rules are now normalized, meaning that when saved the rule set is simplified to the most simple common structure.</p>
</li></ul><ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>The Advanced Rules page now has an Summary screen, which displays only the set rules for a Role</p>
</li></ul><ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>Setting Role Members has been simplified. Match Operators have been hard coded for different value types in order to make the process less error prone.</p>
</li></ul><ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>We have introduced the concept of Role Namespaces, allowing administrators to sort Roles into groups. An logged in administrator may thus only see the Roles in the namespace in which they themselves belong, while being a member of a Role belonging to the &quot;blank&quot; namespace gives access to all. The purpose of this is to allow several different organizational units to be using their own CA, each creating their own Roles with similar names, but without interfering with each other.</p>
</li></ul><ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>Last but not least, roles management has been built into the EJBCA RA as well, allowing RA users working on a proxy RA to administrate their own roles without needing access to the CA.</p>
</li></ul><p   
>Speaking of the EJBCA RA, we have added API calls for proxying CMP requests and a limited subset of the WS interface to it. This allows the RA to act as a proxy for both CMP calls far more efficiently than the old asynchronous CMP Proxy, as well as act as a proxy for the MS Autoenrollment Gateway which was released with EJBCA 6.7.0.</p>
<p   
>Approval profiles in CAs and Certificate Profiles can now be set per action, allowing one approval profile to be used for e.g. Adding/Editing end entities and another for revoking.</p>
<p   
>Some passwords can be configured to be stored in an encrypted form in the database. From EJBCA 6.8.0 and on encryption can be configured with a stronger setting than the default by modifying the password.encryption.key in cesecore.properties. Only change this value when you are sure that all nodes that will store passwords (end entity clear text passwords and crypto token auto activation codes) are upgraded and can read the new format.</p>

><strong class=" ">Security notice</strong><br/>The Xalan 2.7.1 library previously bundled with EJBCA is subject to a potential security issue (CVE-2014-0107). EJBCA does not by itself use the vulnerable functions from Xalan and there is thus no real vulnerability in EJBCA. We have anyway chosen to remove this bundled library from EJBCA.</p>
<p   
>As the application server also uses Xalan, users are recommended to upgrade to JBoss EAP 6.3 or later which includes the newer Xalan version. Alternatively, Red Hat provides patches for earlier EAP versions. For JBoss AS 7.1.1 it is possible to follow our instructions in the installation guide for how to instead use the libraries bundled with EJBCA.<br/><br/>Read the full Changelog for details.</p>

>EJBCA 6.3.0 introduces a powerful new feature for Enterprise and Appliance users: the EJBCA Peer System protocol. The purpose is to allow secure communication over TLS between peered installations of EJBCA, doing away with the need of direct database publishing in order to propagate certificates and certificate information. This means that direct and synchronous communication is now possible between a Certificate Authorities and their associated Verification Authorities, also enabling verification of synchronization status and health.</p>
<p   
>EJBCA Peer System represents a step forward in how setup up complex multi-system installations, and we have great hopes for what we will be able to make possible in EJBCA in the future.</p>

<p   
>This, the first release of 2015, is a minor release primarily geared towards optimization and stabilization of the 6.2 branch. We have primarily optimized GUI behavior in regard to cryptotokens referencing many keys, as well as sorted out some documentation issues. QA procedures have also been revised and improved, which is the &quot;known issues&quot; list below is longer than in previous releases.</p>
<p   
>All in all, 24 issues have been fixed or implemented for this release.</p>
<p   
>Behavior of OCSP responder has been changed slightly in order to improve performance. Status of the OCSP signing certificate's CA is now only checked when the cache is reloaded, instead of at every request. If unsure how long the timeout is set for, check the value ocsp.signingCertsValidTime in ocsp.properties.</p>

 If you are customizing the EJBCA public web to be embedded in a frame, note that EJBCA now uses the X-FRAME-OPTIONS HTTP header, preventing web GUIs from being framed in modern browsers.</p>
<p   
>Some CLI commands have changed names, though legacy support for the old names still remains. Some commands have had to undergo syntax changes, and they are as follows:</p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>General - Explicit password flag for CLI user password has been changed to '--clipassword'</p>
</li></ul><p   
>All CLI commands' help pages can be summoned with the '--help' switch</p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>CaImportCACommand - Command performs two different tasks depending on the number of arguments, which are mostly mutually exclusive and unswitched, hence impossible to identify.</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>CaImportCertCommand - The optional values e-mail, cert profile and ee profile must be used with a switch.</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>CaInitCommand - The catokenproperties is now optional (no need to substitute with null if unused)</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>CaRenewCACommand - The &lt;regenerate keys&gt; argument has been turned into a flag (-R), and a switch was added for the Custom Not Before value.</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>InternalKeyBindingCreateCommand - The &quot;-property&quot; switch is no longer needed. Instead optional properties are loaded dynamically, but must be entered with a &quot;&quot; preceding the property name.</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>InternalKeyBindingModifyCommand - Multiple &quot;-addtrust&quot; and &quot;-removetrust&quot; are no longer allowed, instead a separator &quot;,&quot; may be used. Also, the --property switch is no longer used, instead properties are loaded dynamically and used like with InternalKeyBindingCreateCommand</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>AddEndEntityCommand - Password parameter now input with --password flag, leaving blank will prompt. subjectAltName and email have been made optional and equipped with flags. certificateprofile, endentityprofile and hardtokenissuer have been given flags. hardtokenissuer options won't appear at all unless hard tokens been turned on.</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>Services - The -listFields|-listProperties switched have been turned into commands instead</p>
</li><li class=" "><p

>Note 1: OCSP responses no longer includes the Root CA Certificate, unless the Root CA is the OCSP signer, and it is configured to include the signer certificate. Having OCSP responses as small as possible is an important performance feature, and since the<br/>client must have the root certificate as trusted there is no need to include the root certificate in the chain.</p>
<p   
>Note 2: In EJBCA 6.1.0 the Public Web interface logo filename was changed. If you have customized your own logo, you need to rename the logo filename from 'logotype.png' or 'ejbca_pki_by_primekey_logo.png' to 'banner_ejbca-public.png'.</p>

<p   
>EJBCA 6.0.0 is the latest major release of EJBCA, and both introduces and redefines a number of core concepts. Foremost amongst these are:</p>
<p   
><strong class=" ">Main Changes</strong></p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>The concept of Crypto Tokens has been introduced in order to separate CAs from the keys tied to them. Crypto Tokens allow for reuse of keystores between CAs or for other services like OCSP, and make configuration of keystores, both hard and soft, far simpler.</p>
</li></ul><p   
>For additional information see Admin Guide and <a  class="external-link" href="http://blog.ejbca.org/2013/08/whats-new-in-ejbca-6-part-1-crypto.html">http://blog.ejbca.org/2013/08/whats-new-in-ejbca-6-part-1-crypto.html</a></p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>CMP is now fully configurable in the Admin GUI, and you can simultaneously use multiple different CMP configurations, called CMP aliases. For additional information see Admin Guide and <a  class="external-link" href="http://blog.ejbca.org/2013/09/whats-new-in-ejbca-6-part-2-cmp-aliases.html">http://blog.ejbca.org/2013/09/whats-new-in-ejbca-6-part-2-cmp-aliases.html</a></p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>There is a new concept of Internal Key Bindings to bind a Crypto Token to a certificate for different usages, OCSP signing and TLS authentication. For additional information see User Guide and <a  class="external-link" href="http://blog.ejbca.org/2013/10/whats-new-in-ejbca-6-part-3-internal.html">http://blog.ejbca.org/2013/10/whats-new-in-ejbca-6-part-3-internal.html</a></p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>The merging of EJBCA and VA deployments. VA deployments are no longer anemic versions of EJBCA, instead all VA functionality has been merged into EJBCA proper. This for a single installation procedure, and for a machine to function as a CA and a VA simultaneously.</p>
</li></ul><p   
><strong class=" ">Other Noteworthy Changes</strong></p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>Internal OCSP services are no longer configurable from the CA, but are instead automatically set up and always active.</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>OCSP code has been brought up to CESeCore standard</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>The installation work-flow and ant targets have changed to be more logical for deployment and installation.</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>'Certificate Request History' is now disabled by default for new CAs.</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>PKCS11 crypto tokens can now be managed by slot label (in addition to slot number and index)</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>JBoss 7.1 and EAP 6 are now supported</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>Java 7 is now the default recommended Java version.</p>
</li></ul><p   
><strong class=" ">Minor Changes</strong></p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>The term 'Admin Group' has been mostly purged and replaced with 'Role', as has the term 'User' been replaced by 'End Entity'</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>Changes to certificate profiles:</p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "><p   
>The PKIX QCSyntax-v1 identifier from RFC3739 has been removed and will never be generated.</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>If &quot;PKIX QCSyntax-v2&quot; in the Certificate Profile is unchecked, no QCStatement with QCSyntax will be generated (new behavior).</p>
</li><li class=" "><p   
>If &quot;PKIX QCSyntax-v2&quot; in the Certificate Profile is checked, a QCStatement with PKIX QCSyntax-v2 will be generated (same as before).</p>
</li></ul></li><li class=" "><p   
>The default management CA has been renamed from AdminCA to ManagementCA.</p>

<hr>
<p   
>This minor release primarily addressed issues that cropped up during manual testing for Common Criteria<br/>certification. Quite some effort was also put into stabilizing the 5.0.x release.</p>
<p   
><strong class=" ">Noteworthy changes</strong><br/>- Support has been added for incorporating external plugins in the EJBCA EAR file at build time.<br/>- Some XSS issues have been corrected.<br/>- Authorization checks have tightened up in accordance to Common Criteria demands.<br/>- Access rules for logging have finally been reconciled between CESeCore and EJBCA. The implication of this is<br/>that the old EJBCA rules have been converted to the newer CESeCore rules, while those rules lacking application<br/>in the new Secure Audit logging have been removed (all old rules matching /log_functionality/view_log/*_entries).<br/>Thus in the new logging system it is no longer possible to add rules to a role allowing that rule to only view a<br/>certain type of log event depending on what entry that event was registered as. Old rules are upgraded during<br/>&lt;ant post-upgrade&gt;, which means that Supervisor roles won't work until this step is performed. Installations made in<br/>5.0.0 or 5.0.1 need to be upgraded manually (see UPGRADE document), while installations upgraded from 4.0.x will have<br/>their rules upgraded as part of the standard upgrade procedure.<br/>- Chinese characters are now supported in DN attributes for End Entity Profiles.<br/>- Lots of small bug fixes.</p>

<p   
><strong class=" ">Noteworthy changes</strong><br/>- Support for Permanent Identifiers (RFC4043)<br/>- Support for authorityInformationAccess in CRLs (RFC4325)<br/>- Split xdocs in two separate sites, <a  class="external-link" href="http://ejbca.org">ejbca.org</a> site and documentation site<br/>- Documentation of EJBCA Djigzo integration</p>

        <h2 class="heading "><span>EJBCA 5.0.0</span></h2>
<hr>
<p   
>This major release marks a new step as EJBCA is now built on the Common Criteria certified secure core: CESeCore. The<br/>negative implications of this for the end customer should be minimal, as database changes are few and far between, and<br/>there is a clear upgrade path from EJBCA 4.0.x</p>
<p   
>CESeCore primarily provides two new features that will be of interest to the end user:<br/>- The old database audit log system has been removed and replaced by a new security audit function that is capable of storing integrity protected audit records in the database.<br/>- Integrity protection has been introduced to essential tables. This means that rows in these tables can't be modified through direct database interaction without invalidating the row.</p>
<p   
>Additionally, the following feature has been introduced.<br/>- The Command Line Interface now uses authentication. Users are drawn from the standard End Entities list, and have the same respective roles. A default CLI user is created as a part of startup/upgrade in order to allow allow the CLI to be used without authentication,<br/>and can be turned off from the Administration Interface. This user is defined in ejbca.properties</p>
<p   
>For administrators, the following changes are worth noting:<br/>- When upgrading from 4.x to 5.x new approval requests created in a 5.x instance can not be read in a 4.x instance. So if you require uptime and roll-back capabilities, only allow to create new approval requests from an 4.x host.<br/>- A &quot;Super Administrator Role&quot; is created during either bootstrap or upgrade to create a role for the default CLI user.<br/>- 'Admin Groups' have been renamed 'Roles'. Relevant database tables remain unchanged.<br/>- 'Admin Entities' are now referred to as 'Access User Aspects'.<br/>- 'Users' are now ubiquitously referred to as 'End Entities'.<br/>- Usage of access rules have in some cases changed, and some new access rules have been added (edit publishers). After an upgrade to 5.0, verify your roles and privileges.</p>

<p   
>This is a maintenance release - 16 issues have been resolved. Only fixes and layout improvements, no new features.</p>
<p   
>This release fixes an upgrade issue from 3.6.x to 3.11.x and also a MySQL/MyISAM related issue in the 3.11.0 release.</p>
<p   
>A few uncaught regressions from 3.10.x and 3.11.0 were fixed, and as usual David Carella of Linagora added some Admin GUI layout improvements.</p>
<p   
><strong class=" ">Noteworthy changes</strong><br/>- It is now possible to easily upgrade from EJBCA 3.6.x to 3.11.x<br/>- Fixed a MySQL mapping that did not work when using the MyISAM storage engine and UTF-8 encoding.<br/>- ETSI QC value limit can now have the value zero.<br/>- Admin GUI improvements from David Carella of Linagora.<br/>- Added a favicon to the EJBCA web interfaces.<br/>- Fixed an issue causing cached end entity profiles (not default) to be changed for some actions in the admin GUI.<br/>- Fixed an issue where session information spilled over to other edits when using the &quot;Back to certificate profiles&quot; link.<br/>- Fixed an issue where using the required flag on Cardnumber in a end entity profile gave error about missing unstructured address.<br/>This also resolved an issue where the DN field Unstructured Address did not work.</p>
<p   
>NOTE: If you have been using the SEIS Cardnumber extension in End Entity Profiles (not default), this setting had an internal collision with the UnstructuredAddress DN field, so they could not be used at the same time. There was a problem using the UnstructuredAddress lately.</p>
<p   
>The issue was resolved by changing the internal number for Cardnumber. This is not possible to upgrade automatically.<br/>* If you used SEIS Cardnumber * you must manually edit your end entity profiles and re-check the 'use' checkbox after upgrade to 3.11.1.<br/>This should affect a very small number of users.</p>

<hr>
<p   
>This is a major release with several new features - 47 issues have been resolved.<br/>One major goal with this release is to prepare for a seamless migration to EJBCA 4.0. To make the migration path to EJBCA 4.0 a simple plug-in upgrade, EJBCA 3.11 introduces database changes needed to make the schema fully compatible and consistent across all supported databases.</p>
<p   
>Upgrade to EJBCA 3.11 should be simple as usual, just follow the instructions in doc/UPGRADE.</p>
<p   
><strong class=" ">Noteworthy changes</strong><br/>- Possibility to configure CA not to use certificate and user store, meaning that CA can issue certificates without having to access database after service startup.<br/>- External OCSP responder can now function as a validation authority serving OCSP, CRLs and CA certificates.<br/>- Certificate store access via HTTP according to RFC4387 standard.<br/>- Possibility in WebService Interface to specify extended information when editing users.<br/>- Possibility to specify custom certificate serial number for end entities using CMP protocol. CMP RA secret can now also be specified per CA.<br/>- Upgrade database schema to be consistent across databases.<br/>- Add a few new columns to database tables, a preparation to be used in EJBCA 4.0.<br/>- Improvements in the Glassfish support, now also usable with Oracle database.<br/>- Several other new features and extended key usages, GUI improvements and performance enhancements - many of which are contributed by Linagora.</p>
<p   
><strong class=" ">Important notes</strong><br/>1. If you have a very large database (&gt;1 million issued certificates) you can probably not run the database schema upgrade scripts automatically, but you want better control of the changes. You can then run the upgrade SQL statements manually. You can find them under src/upgrade/310_311, with an individual sql file for your database.<br/><br/>2. The external OCSP responder module have many added features in this release. This has caused some configuration file changes. See VA Installation documentation. Specifically the CA Publisher datasource configuration has moved from ocsp.properties to va-publisher.properties, a much better location. Health check settings has moved from ocsp.properties to va.properties.</p>
<p   
>3. The database schema has changed. If you run an external OCSP responder the database schema on that must also be updated for the VA/OCSP publisher to work. The two new columns rowVersion and rowProtection does not have to be set to any specific value.</p>
<p   
>4. The error message when publishing fails has changed from &quot;EXTERNAL OCSP ERROR&quot; to &quot;Validation Authority ERROR&quot;. If you have scripts monitoring this, they must be updated.</p>

>What need to be done are to:<br/>1. Read column with DN to me migrated from table.<br/>2. Run 'newDN=CertTools.stringToBCDNString(oldDN)'.<br/>3. Update column with DN in table.</p>
<p   
>Columns that need updating are:<br/>issuerDN in table CRLData<br/>subjectDN, issuerDN in table CertificateData<br/>subjectDN in table UserData.</p>
<p   
>If a tool is needed to perform the migration, please contact us. See <a  class="external-link" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ejbca">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ejbca</a></p>
